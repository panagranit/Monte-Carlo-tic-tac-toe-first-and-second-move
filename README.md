 Tic-Tac-Toe with Monte Carlo AI

A Python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe that uses Monte Carlo simulation to make optimal moves.

## Features
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for move selection
- 500 simulated games per decision
- Complete game state validation
- Optimal move finding for player X

## Usage
Run the program:
```python
python main.py
```

The board positions are numbered 0-8:
```
0 | 1 | 2
---------
3 | 4 | 5
---------
6 | 7 | 8
```

The program will output recommended first and second moves for player X based on Monte Carlo simulations.
